**Tweet 1/5:**
Just shipped something cool! 🚀

Built an AI pottery expert that actually knows its stuff - 28,856+ pottery knowledge embeddings powering real-time responses about ceramic arts, techniques, materials & troubleshooting.

Deployed on @mastra_ai Cloud with A2A protocol integration.

**Tweet 2/5:**
🛠️ Tech Stack:
- @mastra_ai Framework (agents, tools, workflows)
- @pinecone vector DB (28,856 embeddings)
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini + text-embedding-3-small
- A2A Protocol (Agent-to-Agent communication)
- JSON-RPC 2.0

All TypeScript, all deployed.

**Tweet 3/5:**
🎯 What it does:
✅ Answers pottery questions (clay types, glazing, firing)
✅ RAG-powered search through rich knowledge base
✅ Real-time streaming responses
✅ Conversation memory & context
✅ Works on @telex_im platform via A2A

**Tweet 4/5:**
🔥 Cool features:
- Pinecone similarity search (0.6+ threshold)
- Metadata extraction (topic, content, sources)
- Multi-turn conversations with session management
- Tool calls with artifacts
- Proper error handling & validation

**Tweet 5/5:**
Built as part of @HNGinternship Stage 3 task.

## With Screenshot/Demo CTA

I built an AI pottery expert that actually knows its craft 🏺

Try asking it:
"What temperature should I fire stoneware?"
"How do I fix cracks in pottery?"
"Explain the raku firing technique"

28,856+ embeddings • RAG-powered • Real-time streaming

## Tips for posting:

1. **Add a demo video/GIF** showing the agent responding to a pottery question
2. **Tag relevant accounts**: @mastra_ai, @pinecone, @HNGinternship, @telex_im
3. **Use hashtags**: #HNG13, #AI, #BuildInPublic, #MastraFramework, #RAG
4. **Post timing**: Best engagement 9-11am or 7-9pm EST
5. **Pin the thread** to your profile for visibility
6. **Engage with replies** - respond to questions about your tech choices

---

## Visual Ideas:

1. **Before/After**: Mock knowledge base vs. 28K embeddings
2. **Architecture diagram**: Pinecone → Mastra → A2A → Telex
3. **Code snippet**: The RAG search function
4. **Response comparison**: GPT-4 vanilla vs. Your RAG agent
5. **Terminal/logs**: Showing the agent working
